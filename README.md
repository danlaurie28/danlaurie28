I am danlaurie 28

I am a student at both RMIT and BCAI. I am studying blockchain technology at both. I like to keep up with what is going on in the cryptocurrency space and i hold a number of different coins.
As of right now the main area of blockchain that i am focussed on is tokenisation. I believe that it is a massive growth sector in the industry and the potential for expansion is huge.
